Design principles Used: 

Feedback - When the user clicks on a circle and drags it, the user can immediately see the circle move about the page. Feedback should be "immediate and synchronized with user action"

Mapping - When the user drags a circle, it bumps into the other circles like gravity. This shows a "relationship between controls and their movements and te results in the world". Also, "the effect corresponds to the expectation".
